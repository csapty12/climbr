# If you are not using standard Expo prebuild (CNG), you might want to un-ignore android/ios
# But for typical Expo managed workflow or CNG, ignoring them is cleaner until you eject/prebuild locally.
# However, many people commit android/ios for "Bare" workflow.
# Given this is likely Expo CNG or Managed until specified, we'll confirm with user or stick to standard.
# Actually, usually for Expo one DOES NOT commit android/ios folders if using Prebuild.
# If they are present, we should probably check if they are generated.
# Let's assume standard Expo recommended gitignore.
